                <h2>The Beginning of Pawstry</h2>
                <hr class="divider">
                <p>The Pawstry Library Café was established as a partnership business inspired by the love for coffee, pastries, and furry animals such as cats and dogs. The name <strong>“Pawstry”</strong> comes from the combination of “paw” and “pastry,” which represents the café’s warm and friendly atmosphere that welcomes both people and animal lovers.</p>
                <p>The café was designed to feel like a library—quiet, cozy, and comfortable—where customers can relax, read, study, or spend time while enjoying coffee and pastries in a calm environment inspired by the presence and comfort that pets bring.</p>
                <p>The idea started after noticing that many people feel stressed from school, work, and daily responsibilities. The founders wanted to create a space that offers comfort similar to what people feel when they are around cats and dogs: safe, relaxed, and happy.</p>
